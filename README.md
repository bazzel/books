## Technical details

### Daemonite's Material UI

Since I never used [Material Design](https://material.io/) before, I thought this project would make a good candidate. For this I used [Daemonite's Material UI](http://daemonite.github.io/material/), which uses Bootstrap with some customizations added to it. Instructions on how to use Daemonite's Material UI in a Rails project can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/bazzel/0226bf815c9018388ae2e7e3bc438c57).
